# Invisibility 
---
 
You cast the spell of invisibility, you sneak past a few fast asleep orcs, making your way to the main gate  when all of a sudden your invisibility starts to wareoff. 
Do you either [dash](dash.md) for the main gate or try to [jump](rjump.md) over the fence with you magical staff?
