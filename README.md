# Choose Your Own Adventure Project
#### Escape 
---
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our knowledge of linking various files together by creating our own adventure project and showcasing our knowledge of dealing with and avoiding merge conflicts by working with a fellow classmate.
Every link you click on will lead to a certain set of choices which will determine how the adventure ends for you.
